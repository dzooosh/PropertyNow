# Challenge statement

The problem the Portfolio Project is intended to solve is to create a quick access where buyers can easily access houses of their choice in their proximity.

Successes in building the sites was creating platforms for both the buyers and admin. Admin is able to add, remove, update properties on the site. Also, have the ability to convert registered users as admin when necessary.

Areas for improvement include better user interface to create a more attractive display for the user/buyer. Also making the site easier by accessing the location automatically, allowing for social logins which makes it easier to sign up and access on a go.

Lessons learned include the sign up/login logic, API implementation, Blueprints, Authentication using JWT.
